The pattern that is searched in the file is referred to as the regular expression (grep stands for globally search for regular expression and print out). grep(1) - Linux manual page https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/grep.1.html grep, egrep, fgrep - print lines that match patterns sed, a stream editor https://www.gnu.org/software/sed/manual/sed.html sed is a stream editor. A stream editor is used to perform basic text transformations on an input stream (a file or input from a pipeline). While in some ways similar to an editor which permits scripted edits (such as ed), sed works by making only one pass over the input(s), and is consequently more efficient. But it is sed’s ability to filter text in a pipeline which particularly distinguishes it from other types of editors. Sed Command in Linux/Unix with examples - GeeksforGeeks https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sed-command-in-linux-unix-with-examples/ SED command in UNIX is stands for stream editor and it can perform lot’s of function on file like, searching, find and replace, insertion or deletion. Though most common use of SED command in UNIX is for substitution or for find and replace. By using SED you can edit files even without opening it, which is much quicker way to find and replace something in file, than first opening that file in VI Editor and then changing it. SED is a powerful text stream editor. Can do insertion, deletion, search and replace(substitution). SED command in unix supports regular expression which allows it perform complex pattern matching.

These are the core utilities which are expected to exist on every operating system. 2 Common options https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/manual/coreutils.html#toc-Common-options-1 ‘--help’ Print a usage message listing all available options, then exit successfully. ‘--version’ Print the version number, then exit successfully. ‘--’ Delimit the option list. Later arguments, if any, are treated as operands even if they begin with ‘-’. For example, ‘sort -- -r’ reads from the file named -r. ‘-S suffix’ ‘--suffix=suffix’ Append suffix to each backup file made with -b. If this option is not specified, the value of the SIMPLE_BACKUP_SUFFIX environment variable is used. And if SIMPLE_BACKUP_SUFFIX is not set, the default is ‘~’, just as in Emacs. GNU Coreutils https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/manual/coreutils.html#toc-Introduction-1 27.2 Symbolic Modes https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/manual/coreutils.html#Symbolic-Modes Symbolic modes represent changes to files’ mode bits as operations on single-character symbols. They allow you to modify either all or selected parts of files’ mode bits, optionally based on their previous values, and perhaps on the current umask as well (see Umask and Protection). The format of symbolic modes is: [ugoa…][-+=]perms…[,…] where perms is either zero or more letters from the set ‘rwxXst’, or a single letter from the set ‘ugo’. 27.2.1 Setting Permissions users operation permissions u the user who owns the file; g other users who are in the file’s group; o all other users; a all users; the same as ‘ugo’. The operation part tells how to change the affected users’ access to the file, and is one of the following symbols: + to add the permissions to whatever permissions the users already have for the file; - to remove the permissions from whatever permissions the users already have for the file; = to make the permissions the only permissions that the users have for the file. The permissions part tells what kind of access to the file should be changed; it is normally zero or more of the following letters. As with the users part, the order does not matter when more than one letter is given. Omitting the permissions part is useful only with the ‘=’ operation, where it gives the specified users no access at all to the file. r the permission the users have to read the file; w the permission the users have to write to the file; x the permission the users have to execute the file, or search it if it is a directory. For example, to give everyone permission to read and write a regular file, but not to execute it, use: a=rw To remove write permission for all users other than the file’s owner, use: go-w The above command does not affect the access that the owner of the file has to it, nor does it affect whether other users can read or execute the file. To give everyone except a file’s owner no permission to do anything with that file, use the mode below. Other users could still remove the file, if they have write permission on the directory it is in. go= Another way to specify the same thing is: og-rwx The head and tail commands in LINUX | Baeldung on
